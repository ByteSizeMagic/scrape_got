# ScrapeGot

Welcome to Scrape_Got, I scrape and I know things! 

I'm a current student at the [Flatiron School](https://flatironschool.com/) and this is my CLI Project. This CLI gem scrapes data from [An API of Ice and Fire](https://anapioficeandfire.com/). It displays a simple menu to the user and gives them a choice of seeing all the books or 20 houses. This was a fun learning experience and I hope to flesh it out further as my knowledge improves. :P

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'scrape_got'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install scrape_got

## Usage

Once the gem is installed enter 'scrape_got' into the command line to start Scrape_Got. The user will be presented with options to follow on screen.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
